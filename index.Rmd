# Research Question  

When sports are played with a balanced home and away schedule, the home team wins over 50% of their matches (Courneya & Carron, 1992).  

For the PSY6422 assignment I am visualising home advantage within the National Basketball Association (NBA) from the 2015 season till the 2018 season.  

The visualisation will aim to address the following question:  

**Do home teams, on average, score more points than away teams?**  

\**Season span: season 2015 (2015-2016), season 2016 (2016-2017), season 2017 (2017-2018) and season 2018 (2018-2019)*

\**Data from subsequent seasons are excluded, the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced home advantage (e.g., through crowd restrictions)*    

# Data Origin  

The data set **games.csv** was obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games), the data set was published by Nathan Lauga.  

The data was collected from the [NBA statistics website](https://www.nba.com/stats/), please click [here](https://github.com/Nathanlauga/nba-predictor) for more information (and please click [here](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/blob/master/docs/table_of_contents.md) for more information on Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints).  

The data set contains NBA games from 05/10/2003 till present (the data is updated periodically; the expected update frequency is quarterly).  

To particularise, the data set contains information on  game date,  game ID, game status (final means that the game was completed), home team ID, visitor team ID, **season**, team ID of the home team, **points scored by the home team**, field goal percentage of the home team,  free throw percentage of the home team, three-point percentage of the home team, assists of the home team, rebounds of the home team, team ID of the away team, **points scored by the away team**, field goal percentage of the away team, free throw percentage of the away team, three-point percentage of the away team, assists of the away team, rebounds of the away team and **wins of the home team**.

```

The home team scores, on average, more than the away team (please see the subtitle).

However, the number of games won by the home team (blue) and the away team (red) appears very similar. The impact of home advantage may, thus, not be very large.

\**Please allow eight seconds for the graph to update*  

# Summary
In sum, the visualisation shows that, although the home team, on average, scores more points than the away team, the difference is not large; the visualisation suggests that the number of points scored by home teams and away teams are similar. When exploring home advantage data, it may, thus, be useful to visualise variables.

If I had more time, I would create an interactive web application, through the shiny package. I would like to give users the opportunity to decide which season to look at.
Moreover, I would have visualised additional variables (e.g., fouls, three throws or home win ratios) to explore how they impact home advantage.
Lastly, I would have compared visualisations of a pre-Covid-19 season with visualisations of a Covid-19 season. To explore if the Covid-19 pandemic influenced home advantage.
