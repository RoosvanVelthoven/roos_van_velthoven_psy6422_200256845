What is the project?
In short, it is my project for the PSY6422 module.
The project is complete, it includes raw data, scripts, documentation, and visualisations shared in a way that allows visualisations to be reproduced and understood.

What is in each folder?
roos_van_velthoven_psy6422_200256845 = contains the below folders and .gitignore, .Rhistory, .Rprofile, core_code.R (code for the visualisations), index.html, index.Rmd, README.txt, renv.lock, roos_van_velthoven_psy6422_200256845.Rproj and visualisation.gif (same gif as in the figs folder)

attic = code that I used to play around with, or code that I do not want to delete as I might need it later on
data = contains two folders (processed and raw) and my codebook
       processed = contains csv files that I saved during the creation of my visualisations (nba_final_df.csv contains the data needed for my visualisation, nba_relabelled.csv contains data of interest, for all seasons, with recoded variables and nba_2018_2015.csv contains data of interest, for solely the 2015-2018 seasons, with recoded variables)
       raw = contains games.csv, which I downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games)
figs = contains graphs I created during the project (nba1.png, nba2.png, nba3.png and nba4.png) and a GIF of my graphs (visualisation.gif)
notes = contains my wrap-up self-assessment
renv = contains my renv files
